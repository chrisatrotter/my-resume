      <p>Hi, my name’s Christopher and I’m a passionate software engineer with interests in event-driven architecture, functional programming, stream processing and concurrency theory.
I recently graduated with a master in computer science, where the focus of the study was to interpret concurrency as higher-dimensional objects using formal methods such as category theory, formal verification, model checking, and algebraic topology.
As part of the journey, I learned fundamental concepts of concurrency theory, programming languages, event-based vs. state-based models and application of category theory within a functional programming paradigm.</p>

<p>I am focused on putting my passion and skills to good use by supporting organizations and projects with their difficult engineering problems.</p>

</p><p>We give a formalization of Pratt’s intuitive sculpting process for higherdimensional automata (HDA). Based on this, we show that sculptures, Pratt’s Chu spaces, and Johansen’s ST-structures are in close correspondence. We also develop an algorithm to decide whether a HDA can be sculpted and use this to show that some natural acyclic HDA are not sculptures. We believe that our result shed new light on the intuitions behind sculpting as a method of modeling concurrent behavior, showing the precise reaches of its expressiveness. We also show that there are sculptures whose unfoldings cannot be sculpted, and that sculptures are the same as Euclidean cubical complexes. This exposes a close connection between geometric and combinatorial models for concurrency which may be of use for both areas.</p>
